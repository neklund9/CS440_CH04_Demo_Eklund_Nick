# CS440_CH04_Demo_Eklund_Nick
Repo for CS440 Test 3
I chose the GNU General Public License v3.0 due to its copyleft protection. For this repository, I value the ability for myself to freely share the information that I have accumulated through proper means. I don't want this data to become locked down by a corporation who decides to use my brilliant version of sorting that operates in constant time to benefit their program and become rulers of the world. I want my ground breaking discovery to be free to use by anyone including all derivatives of it. If Joe Cool comes along and modifies my code so it is even more robust, but it used mine as a foundation, I want everyone to be able to use it for free as long as credit is given where credit is due. It is a pay-it-forward approach that is able to turn a simple idea into a robust concept. I want this information to remain in the public domain for all future versions of the work. Since I am not seeking any monetary reimbursement for this knowledge, I did not go for ones such as the Apache License 2 which protect patent rights.

By the way, I included a .gitignore file in this repository since Professor Price said that he would fail anyone who make a github repo and did not include a .gitignore file since it messes with his stuff :)
